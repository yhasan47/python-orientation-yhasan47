    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. \n",
    "Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember saying `print('Print!')`??  \n",
    "`print` is a function that we have been using up until now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember `SUM()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()` in SQL?\n",
    "All if those are also functions. \n",
    "They will generally take an input, do something with it, and return a new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General syntax: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name( parameters ):\n",
    "   \"\"\"function_docstring\"\"\"\n",
    "   function_suite\n",
    "   return [expression]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function blocks begin with the keyword `def` (define) followed by the function name and parentheses ( `( )` ).\n",
    "* If your function requires some sort of input to be able to do it's job, you would place these within the parenthesis. \n",
    "These parameters (such as the `parameters` value in our example) are only placeholders that will represent something else when the function is being used.\n",
    "* The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or `docstring`.\n",
    "In our example, the docstring is the comment within the triple quotes, `\"\"\"`\n",
    "* The `function_suite` is the place where you write code to do some sort of functionality.\n",
    "* The statement `return [expression]` exits a function, optionally passing back an expression or value to the caller. \n",
    "A return statement with value is the same as return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**WHITE SPACE MATTERS**  \n",
    "If you do not use appropriate whitespace, your code won't work. \n",
    "When writing a function You must indent the contents of the function (4 spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a function that will create a person."

    "* `create_person` accepts 4 _parameters_ as input: `first_name, last_name, age, occupation`.\n",
    "The trick here is to understand that these parameters haven't been defined yet. \n",
    "They are simply placeholders!\n",
    "* Note the colon at the end of the first line! \n",
    "This is important.\n",
    "* The next line is the docstring. \n",
